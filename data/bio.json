  "bio": {
    "main": "Soobeen Woo is a media artist and ceramicist based in Bremen (Germany) and Busan/Daegu (Korea). She explores the unseen, its traces, and the boundaries of perception, critically addressing human-centered systems of recognition. Her work manifests the ways in which what cannot be sensed can still exist, and how disappearance can, paradoxically, reveal the essence of being—realized through sculpture, sound, and digital media.",
    "detail": "Working across diverse media including web and virtual environments, sound installations, and sensor-based interactions, she uses intangible elements such as air, vibration, temperature, and time as conduits for evoking an awareness of the audience's presence and environmental changes. Her ceramic practice forms a significant axis of her work, engaging with the materiality of clay and the transformations that occur during firing, exploring the intersection between material and immaterial states.",
    "conclusion": "As seen in works such as Autopsy of Sensing, Affection Became Condensation, and Unwilling to Be Seen, Woo investigates the uncertainty that precedes perception, the disappearance and remnants of existence, and the ethical tensions between viewer and work. Through this, she proposes the \"right not to be sensed\" and \"alternative modes of existence,\" opening new perceptual fissures where matter and sensation converge."
