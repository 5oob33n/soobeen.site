  "description": "Video exploring virtual study of environment-purifying ant in dystopian setting",
  "detail": "This work is connected to the 'Antio' project and involves the virtual study of the most important creature in that project, the 'Oensa Ant'. This ant has the ability to secrete a substance called 'Perotox', which has the power to purify the environment.",
  "technical_detail": "In a dystopian setting, it is the only living being capable of saving humanity, and humans once again rely on the strength of this small creature to survive. In this work, the ant becomes a more important being than humans, prompting a reevaluation of its status. However, it also highlights the duality of humans' relationship with non-human life forms, as the ant is sometimes exploited by humans despite its crucial role.",
