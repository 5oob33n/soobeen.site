  "description": "Projection mapping addressing social media echo chambers and digital isolation",
  "detail": "'Dreaming Stream' addresses the impact of echo chambers in social media. Through projection mapping onto a building façade, combined with motion graphics and minimalist audio compositions, the work illustrates how digital spaces isolate and amplify beliefs.",
  "technical_detail": "The influence of social media extends both on individual and collective levels. Documentaries like The Social Dilemma highlight how algorithms prioritize personalized content to maximize user engagement, often reinforcing political extremes and conspiracy theories. This leads users to remain in isolated information bubbles, filtering out alternative perspectives.",
  "conceptual_detail": "The work also emphasizes parallel realities and contrasts through media overload. The daily consumption of varied content—such as memes, cat videos, vacation snapshots, alongside war footage—critically reflects on the fragmentation of reality and the relativizing effect of such media saturation. By incorporating images and video footage from Gelsenkirchen, collected through an open call, the installation allows visitors to see their own content projected onto the facade.",
