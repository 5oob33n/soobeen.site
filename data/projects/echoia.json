  "description": "Holographic installation exploring digital identity and reality convergence",
  "detail": "Echoia symbolically represents how digital information approaches reality and how actual identity merges with digital existence. It is expressed through a holographic device positioned at the intersection of the digital and the analog.",
  "technical_detail": "Echoia's dynamic virtual persona is designed to overlap with a physical body, moving in a mutually mimetic manner with the digital entity. It also utilizes AI to infinitely diffuse and transform into multiple entities, generating an ever-flowing vortex that continuously connects them. By viewing this from a narrow, confined space, the work offers a more intimate experience, inviting viewers to project themselves through its reflection and contemplate their own digital self.",
  "conceptual_detail": "The sound is composed from conversations with a virtual AI that embodies Echoia's persona, translated into music.",
