  "detail": "This advertisement for Antio Co., a virtual company, is set within the Antio universe, where hidden agendas and corporate propaganda shape reality. Generated using Pika, Sora, and Suno, and edited with After Effects and Ableton Live, the video adopts a creepy and conspiratorial tone, gradually revealing unsettling truths beneath its polished marketing.",

However, as the narrative unfolds, glitches, distortions, and eerie undertones expose a deeper deception, suggesting that the world outside Antio's promises may not be as habitable as it seems.",
  "conceptual_detail": "The sound design, featuring manipulated voices and distorted audio layers, reinforces the sense of unease, making viewers question the fine line between corporate illusion and reality.",
