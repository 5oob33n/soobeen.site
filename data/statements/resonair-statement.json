    "Resonair is an installation work that visualizes invisible breath and explores how it leaves traces in space before evaporating. Rather than addressing air or environmental issues directly, the piece focuses on how breath—a fundamental act of existence—can leave physical and sensory imprints, only to disappear just as quickly.",
    
    "The work began with a simple question: \"What if breath could be seen, like condensation in winter?\" This question soon led to a deeper inquiry into the sensory moment of disappearance. Breath constantly moves in and out of the body, yet it often escapes perception. Resonair attempts to materialize that imperceptible trace—through vapor, light, repetition, and gradual vanishing.",
    
    "The installation is composed around a single mask placed on a box in the center of the floor. Surrounding it are nine additional masks arranged in a circle, each connected by fiber optic cables. From the mouth of each mask, steam is released in intervals. As time passes, the space slowly fills with vapor, blurring visibility and drawing attention to the density of the shared air. The mask, typically associated with protection, becomes a vessel that releases and records the residue of existence.",
    
    "Without relying on sound visualization or sensor-based interaction, the work uses physical change and atmospheric buildup to generate sensory impact. Air, as an invisible material, becomes a sculptural medium through light, steam, connection, and evaporation. What the viewer experiences is not only visual but something more layered—a residue of breath shared among others, slowly absorbed into the room.",
    
    "Resonair asks: When does presence become perceptible? And can disappearance be the most powerful form of reality? In revisiting the act of breathing, the work ultimately reminds us that to breathe is perhaps the most fundamental and final evidence of being here."
