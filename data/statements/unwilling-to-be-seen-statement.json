    "Unwilling to Be Seen explores the state of an existence that refuses to be perceived. At its core lies a paradox: the very act of seeing can destabilize or destroy what is being seen. In this work, perception is not a neutral process but an intrusive force, and the right not to be sensed is as significant as the desire to be recognized.",
    
    "The installation consists of a black cube interior where a holographic image is suspended in space. The hologram can only be detected when the viewer's gaze engages with it — yet this act of looking directly agitates the system, causing the hologram to tremble and its accompanying sound to distort. The image becomes unstable under observation, suggesting that the gaze itself is a form of interference.",
    
    "Projected within the work is footage of retreating glaciers in New Zealand, captured as they dissolve over time. These slow yet accelerated disappearances become metaphors for the temporal fragility of existence: always present, yet always receding. The glacier is not simply vanishing — it is refusing to remain in a form that can be fully possessed by sight.",
    
    "The sound environment is reactive and unstable, mirroring the fragile relationship between observer and observed. Frequencies shift, distort, and fade when visual contact is made, underscoring the violence of perception. Silence and absence become as charged as noise, articulating moments when the work resists engagement entirely.",
    
    "Unwilling to Be Seen asks: Must existence always be subject to perception? Or can the act of not being perceived be its own form of reality? In a time when visibility is conflated with value, the work argues for the possibility — and the right — of disappearing from view."
